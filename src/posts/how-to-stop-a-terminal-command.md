When you find yourself running a terminal command that you don't know how to exit from. Don't just close the whole terminal, you can close that command!

> If you want to force quit "kill" a running command, you can use "Ctrl + C". Most of the applications running from the terminal will be forced toÂ quit.

There's commands/apps that are designed to keep running until the user asks it to end. And there's other commands/apps that are designed to show the output and exit automatically.

Here's how to stop 3 of the most common commands.

### Nano Editor

Nano is a simple text editor, you could have faced it when dealing with "git commit".

If you're inside **nano** editor. Press `Ctrl + X` to exit. It will prompt you whether you want to save before quitting or not.

### Vim Editor

Vim is another text editor, unlike nano, this one is a sophisticated and powerful one.

If you were running Vim editor, and you want to quit, you can press `Esc` then type a colon `:` followed by `q!` to force quit without saving.

If you want to save, do the same process but replace `q!` with `wq` (which means **w**rite then **q**uit).

### Less

Less is a command that lets you view the content of an input (either the output of another command or a content of a file).

**Less** is different from the editors above, if you're inside commands that don't need input, like "less" or top, you can press `q`.

### Others

Sometimes nothing of the above will work to quit the command gracefully. In these situations, you can use the "kill" command, which is `Ctrl + C`.

Please, try to quit the application gracefully so it can do what it's designed to do when quitting. If it didn't work, just force quit (kill) it.
