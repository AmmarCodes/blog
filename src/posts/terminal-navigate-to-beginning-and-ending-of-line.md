![Navigation to beginning and end ofÂ line](/images/navigation-to-beginning-and-end-of-line.gif)

Sometimes it's handy to go to the beginning of the line, maybe you want to add a forgotten `sudo`? Or to move to the end of the line to add some arguments?

To navigate to the beginning of the current line, use: `CTRL+a`.
To navigate to the end of the current line: `CTRL+e`.

**Hint**: the shortcuts work on most of the applications inside the terminal, like Vim, Emacs and others.
