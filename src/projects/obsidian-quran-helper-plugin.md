An Obsidian plugin that helps you find and insert Quran Ayahs (verses) into your notes.

## The Problem

Many Quran students and researchers use Obsidian for note-taking and knowledge management, but faced challenges integrating Quranic verses:

- Manual copying from online sources was tedious
- Existing plugins required exact Surah:Ayah format references
- Online solutions didn't work offline
- Formatting verses consistently was time-consuming

Users needed a seamless way to search and insert verses without breaking their note-taking flow.

## The Solution

Quran Helper is a community plugin for Obsidian that makes it easy to reference and insert Quranic verses into your personal notes. It's designed for anyone who studies Quran and wants to seamlessly integrate ayahs into their note-taking workflow.

This plugin bridges the gap between spiritual study and personal knowledge management, allowing you to:

- Quickly search and find any ayah without leaving your notes
- Insert verses with proper formatting
- Build a personal knowledge base around Quranic content

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Obsidian Plugin API** - Integration with Obsidian's plugin ecosystem
- **quran-json** - Complete offline Quran database
- **Jest** - Testing framework

## Key Features

- **Fuzzy Search**: Search for any ayah by typing partial letters or words - no need to know exact references
- **Instant Access**: Open Quran modal with a single click from the ribbon
- **No Internet Required**: All Quran data is bundled with the plugin - works completely offline
- **Beautiful Rendering**: Ayahs are rendered with proper formatting and tafsir links
